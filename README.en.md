# PoseNet2Scratch

*Read this in other languages: [English](README.en.md), [日本語](README.md)*

PoseNet2Scratch can detect human pose and add special Scratch blocks that can get x and y position of each part of the body.

It uses [PoseNet](https://medium.com/tensorflow/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-7dd0bc881cd5), a machine learning model , for Real-time Human Pose Estimation. PoseNet advantage is that it can detect human poses quickly and accurately with a normal WebCam without using a special device such as Kinect.

[ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/), a JavaScript library for machine learning, is used to connect it with Scratch 3.
